# CS356-Project-2
A mini-twitter project.

Bug notes:
-Closing one window will close all windows
-Posting a tweet in one window does not update the others, but the other users will still recieve the tweet
-There is little to no input checking for the entry boxes, this may result in an error requiring restart
-as mentioned in the comments, all groups have a member limit of three, once this is filled, members will be added to non-full subgroups, if all groups are full, the entry will not be added
